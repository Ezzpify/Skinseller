# Skinseller
Easier to make images to sell your cool csgo skins.

If you're tired of making big pictures containing all your items in paint/photoshop, then add in the text what exterior it has and then calculate the price, then this program is for you. Because I was tired of doing all that.

With this program you can simply drag an item that you want to sell from your inventory and it will download the information about the item using Steam API and then get the lowest price on the Steam market of the item. It will take this price, then it will cut it to 70% (or whatever you set it to) so you get the price with 70% market value.

It will then show you a window where you can use the price the program provided, or you can set it yourself. If it's a high-tier item it won't be able to pick a price from the market, so you have to enter one yourself.

You can also set the background color, and you can load your own image backgrounds which you can make yourself in photoshop/paint or whatever you prefer. Although it SHOULD be 85x85 pixels.
